# Docopilot

Have an LLM proactively comment on your google doc while working, instead of prompting it yourself every time

## Development

```shell
npm install
```

Log in to clasp (the cli for pushing code to things like google docs sidebars)

```shell
npm run login
```

Create a new google doc connected to this script

```shell
npm run setup
```

(then open the google docs link that is created, though the code won't be there yet)

Deploy the code

```shell
npm run deploy
```

### For other useful commands

See package.json
